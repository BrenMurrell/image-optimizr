# image-optimizr
Some javascript for selectively loading low-res images based on internet speed

## Current state - Umbraco 
This is currently optimised for use with Umbraco using ImageProcessor.Web to serve up low bandwidth versions of images

## Future dev
Next step is to make it platform independent and allow the CMS (WordPress / SilverStripe etc.) to provide the low-res versions
